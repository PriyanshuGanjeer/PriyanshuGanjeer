On December 13, 2021, an amount of 5525 ₹ was deposited in my account through paytm business but due to the closure of the account, this amount was not received in my account. After talking to paytm, it came to know that this amount has arrived in my account only on 13th December 2021. Now the account is closed but I have opened a new account with the same CIF number, in which the amount of 5525 ₹ has not come to me. Even after complaining once more before this, I have not received any proper information so far, please provide me with proper information this time otherwise I will have to complain to RBI.
